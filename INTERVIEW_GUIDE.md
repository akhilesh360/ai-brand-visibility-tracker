# Visual Explanation Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ **30-Second Elevator Pitch**

> *"I built an AI Brand Visibility Tracker that analyzes how mental health brands perform across ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity. It uses a proprietary AVS scoring algorithm to measure brand mentions, then generates automated content briefs to improve AI visibility. Think of it as SEO analytics, but for AI search engines."*

## ðŸ“ˆ **Simple Flow for Interviews**

```
1. COLLECT DATA
   "We test 16 mental health prompts across AI platforms"
   
2. ANALYZE RESPONSES  
   "Proprietary AVS algorithm scores brand performance"
   
3. GENERATE INSIGHTS
   "ML clustering identifies content gaps and opportunities"
   
4. CREATE STRATEGY
   "Automated briefs tell brands exactly what content to create"
```
